      The bleeding had not yet stopped her blood seeping through her red cotton shirt almost blending with the colour. The pain was unbearable but she dared not flinch lest she worsens it. Darkness was gradually creeping in, he had been gone for too long, how much longer would she wait for him? She thought.
The wound would soon get infected due to the exposure with nothing to cover it. A first aid kit was the last thing on her mind when she left home, what could go wrong an exciting vacation to Hawaii. But here she was lost in the middle of nowhere cold, hungry and in pain, what were the odds.
Her mom had bought them the holiday package to Hawaii as a way to mend back their relationship, it was now evident enough that the cracks in her relationship with Hector were clearly visible to their aides. How could Mitch have cheated on her with his secretary? She had suspected countless times something was up, she now had more reason to trust her instincts.
The sound of footsteps snapped her back to the present. The crunching of leaves beneath the boots sent chills through her body. It was already dark she could only make out the silhouettes of the trees.
It must be Hector or so she thought. “Hector” she called out her voice shaky laced with fear. An eerie silence engulfed the already dark forest. Her heart raced. She shouldn’t have coerced Hector to wander deep into the forest. If anything happened to her she only had herself to blame. Did Hector perhaps abandon her, she wouldn’t blame him anyway. She was brought back from her reverie by the sound of footsteps but this time they were close. One footstep, two footsteps, then with the worst timing ever she heard a sharp pain, she let out a suppressed grunt. “Who goes there”. It was a man’s voice but definitely not Hector. She panicked. Before she could turn, a hand held her down while another covered her mouth muffling her attempts to screams. “Get up” he ordered. “I can’t I’m hurt”. “I have a wound on my leg” she pleaded trying to get some sympathy from the man. He roughly touched the wound causing her to flinch. He took his scarf from his neck and quickly but not gently around her leg.

He took his scarf from his neck and quickly but not gently around her leg."I'll get you somewhere safe"."I'm waiting for my usband have you seen him? He is tall with dark brown hair and green eyes". "Well maam I have seen no such person but wat I know is that this is a very risky place for anyone moreso an injured woman to be". With no other choice she obliged.She but her left arm around his neck for support."So whats your name". This wasnt time for small talk she thought but she decide to answer him anyway "Lisa" "Where are you from"."Boston"."I' also from there too."."What a coincidence"Lisa remarked surprised."Its a small world". He said."So what brings you here"."I got into a disagreement with my business patner he wanted to take over the company without my conset.As it stands he has hired hitmen to look for me and kill me so I am in hiding until the dust settles.""Thats horrible"she thought "How could someone be so heartless you shold surely involve the police to get this perso arrested"."His is a very powerful man his name is Hector Suarez".She gasped,her husband?
