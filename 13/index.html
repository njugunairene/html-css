      <p>The police are a force entitled with the duty to protect the citizens of a state through maintaining law and order.Looking at the role of police in Trevor Noah's book "BORN A CRIME" we see the brutality used by the police against the black and their role in fuelling apartheid.</p>

<h2>RIOT CONTROL</h2>
It was the role of the police to curb any riots, they would swoop in with their riot gear and armoured cars and helicopters in the townships.
<h2>SEGREGATION.</h2>
Apertheid was a police state, a system of surveillance and laws designed to keep black people under total control. They were entitled with the role of transferring blacks into reserved areas "racial segregation". The police were to ensure black people did not live in areas meant for white people.
<h2>INTERRACIAL COUPLES</h2>
There were whole police squads whose only job was to go around peeking through windows with the sole purose to catch interracial couples.If they found any they would kick down the door, drag the people out, beat them and arrest them especially for the black people.
<h2>MILITARIZATION</h2>
The police were to lock in the blacks and quell any rebellion. In Soweto the police were militarized. They wore riot gearand drove in "hippos".
<h2>COLOUREDS</h2>
The police would take wrong colour kids found in the wrong colour ares a take them to orphanages that was the reason wy Trevor was not allowed to go outside and play with te other children because her grandmother feared the police would take him.
<h2>FALSE ARRESTS</h2>
In South Africa there is mention of arrests made without investigations with reference to witchcraft and superstitions. An example is given of a man accused of striking another person with lightning when it was a natural catastrophe.
<h2 style="color: blue;">THE KENYAN POLICE</h2>
The Kenyan police in relation to the apartheid police have a few similarities.
<h2>BRUTALITY</h2>
The Kenyan police are violent towards regular citizens when dealing with various situations be it controlling crowds, supressing riots or dealing with suspects.
<h3>False accusation</h3>
There have been an increase in people being accused of crimes they have not comitted largely caused by poor or no investgation.
