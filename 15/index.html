<h1 style="color: blue;">THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN</h1>
- Home Going<br>
<h3>Marriage</h3>
Women have no say in marriage in that their spouses are chosen by their parents, this is seen in the case of Effia whereby she wished to marry Abeeku but she is not allowed to she is therefore forced to marry a white man.
<h3>Inheritance</h3>
Millicent,s mother was not allowed to inherit her husband's property since she is a woman and more especially a black woman. Her husband's fellow whitemen end up inheriting the property. Seen But Not Heard While at Abeeku's compound, Effia asked Abeeku if he would work for the British when he became chief, this earned her glares from Baaba and Cobbe. Her right of expression was infringed since it was believed that women are meant to be seen not heard.
<h3>Objectification</h3>
Women are seen as mere objects of male sexual desire this is seen as in the case of Essi. Role of Women in Homegoing Women are seen as child bearers this is seen in the case of Baaba whereby Cobbe leaves the duty of raising Efia solely to Baaba. The importance of a woman is determined by her ability to give birth, this makes Effia worry alot since she is afraid of not being able to get a child and therefore be branded an outcst.
<h1 style="color: blue;">Treatment Of Women Today</h1>
In this modern society women have made few advancements in relation to their rights and the treatment they receive from their male counterparts.<br> This has been made possible by empowering the girl child. In the political arena aspiring women leaders are treated with animosity by their male competitors.<br>
In the workplace there are obstacles that hinder most women to advance in their careers.<br>
The Role Of Women Today There has been increase of cases of women bein the sole breadwinners in most households due to the irresponsibility of men. This has forced many women to fill the void left bymen especially in parenting.
